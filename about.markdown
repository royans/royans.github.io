I've maintained a personal blog of some kind for over 20 years. I was big never a fan of writing, but it was a way to express ideas and document personal opinions. Over time, my opionions and ideas have changed, but not much. And every now and then, I do a little cleanup and start fresh. In 2024, I'm starting again with this site.

For completeness, I currently work for Google, but the thoughts, comments and opinions I express on this blog and other social media networks are my own. Also, I am human and learning, and from time to time I may have unintentional biases which I find and correct later. Appologies in advance and I'm open to feedback.
